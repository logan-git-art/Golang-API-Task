# Go CRUD APIs with Gin Framework and SQLite

This repository contains a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs built with Go (Golang) using the Gin framework and SQLite database. The APIs allow for managing data stored locally in an SQLite database, providing endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

## Features

-   **Create API:** Allows users to create new records in the SQLite database by sending a POST request with the necessary data.
    
-   **Read API:** Provides endpoints for retrieving records from the database. Users can fetch all records or retrieve specific records by their unique identifiers.
    
-   **Update API:** Enables users to update existing records in the database by sending a PUT request with the updated data.
    
-   **Delete API:** Allows users to delete records from the database using their unique identifiers.
    
-   **SQLite Database:** Utilizes SQLite as the local database for storing and managing data. The database schema is included in the repository for reference.
    

## Technologies Used

-   **Go (Golang):** A statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency.
    
-   **Gin Framework:** A lightweight web framework for Go that provides routing, middleware support, and more, making it easy to build web applications and APIs.
    
-   **SQLite:** A lightweight, serverless database engine that is self-contained, reliable, and widely used in embedded systems and small-scale applications.
